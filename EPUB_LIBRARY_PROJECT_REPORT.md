# EPUB Library Modernization Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project successfully transformed a basic EPUB reader that only scanned the Downloads folder into a comprehensive, modern library management application. The implementation follows Android best practices using the Storage Access Framework (SAF) for secure file access and provides users with complete control over their digital book collection.

## Project Goals

- **Primary**: Evolve from hardcoded Downloads scanning to user-controlled library management
- **Secondary**: Implement modern Android security practices
- **Tertiary**: Provide granular user control over library content

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Library Source Manager Foundation
**Objective**: Create centralized library location management

**Implementation**:
- **File**: `LibraryRepository.kt`
- **Purpose**: Central source of truth for library management
- **Key Features**:
  - URI persistence using SharedPreferences
  - Storage Access Framework integration
  - Excluded books management
  - Secure permission handling

**Technical Details**:
- Stores folder/file URIs in persistent storage
- Maintains access permissions across app sessions
- Manages exclusion list for hidden books
- Uses modern Android SAF instead of legacy file permissions

### Step 2: Settings UI for Library Management
**Objective**: User interface for managing library sources

**Implementation**:
- **File**: `SettingsScreen.kt`
- **New Features**:
  - "Library Sources" settings section
  - "Add Folder" button with system folder picker
  - "Add Files" button with system file picker
  - Visual list of current library sources
  - Delete functionality for each source

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Intuitive folder/file selection using native Android pickers
- Clear visual feedback of active library sources
- One-click removal of unwanted sources

### Step 3: Library Screen Modernization
**Objective**: Replace hardcoded scanning with dynamic source-based scanning

**Implementation**:
- **File**: `LibraryScreen.kt`
- **Major Changes**:
  - Removed hardcoded Downloads folder logic
  - Implemented dynamic source scanning
  - Added recursive folder traversal
  - Integrated exclusion filtering

**Scanning Algorithm**:
1. Fetch saved source URIs from LibraryRepository
2. For each folder URI: recursively scan for `.epub` files
3. Add individual file URIs to collection
4. Filter out excluded books
5. Return complete library collection

**UI Enhancements**:
- Improved empty state with helpful messaging
- Large "Add Books to Library" call-to-action button
- Better user guidance for initial setup

### Step 4: URI-to-File Bridge System
**Objective**: Bridge modern SAF URIs with legacy File-based EPUB parser

**Challenge**: Existing EPUB parsing code required File objects, but SAF provides URIs

**Solution**:
- **File**: `UriFileResolver.kt`
- **Function**: Converts URIs to temporary File objects
- **Process**:
  1. Accept SAF URI input
  2. Copy content to app's private cache
  3. Return File object for parser compatibility
  4. Maintain security while preserving functionality

**Benefits**:
- No need to rewrite entire EPUB parsing engine
- Maintains modern security practices
- Provides seamless compatibility layer

### Step 5: Book Hiding Feature
**Objective**: Allow users to hide books without file deletion

**Implementation**:
- **Files**: `LibraryRepository.kt`, `LibraryScreen.kt`
- **User Interaction**: Long-press on any book
- **Backend Process**:
  1. Add book URI to exclusion list
  2. Persist exclusion in SharedPreferences
  3. Filter excluded books during library scanning

**User Benefits**:
- Non-destructive book management
- Clean library organization
- Reversible hiding (can be undone by re-adding source)

### Step 6: Final Polish and Bug Resolution
**Objective**: Complete UI refinement and bug fixes

**UI Fixes**:
- **Issue**: FAB positioning problems
- **Solution**: Wrapped LibraryScreen in Scaffold composable
- **Result**: Proper Material Design layout compliance

**Functionality Fixes**:
- **Cover Images**: Integrated UriFileResolver for thumbnail display
- **Reader Screen**: Fixed blank screen by resolving URIs to readable files
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused code and resolved detekt warnings

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **LibraryRepository**: Data layer for source and exclusion management
2. **UriFileResolver**: Compatibility layer for URI-to-File conversion
3. **SettingsScreen**: User interface for library configuration
4. **LibraryScreen**: Main library display and interaction

### Data Flow
```
User Selection → SAF URI → LibraryRepository → Persistent Storage
                     ↓
Library Scanning ← URI List ← LibraryRepository
                     ↓
UriFileResolver ← Book URIs ← Filtered Results
                     ↓
File Objects → EPUB Parser → Book Display
```

### Security Model
- **Principle**: Minimal permission scope
- **Method**: Storage Access Framework
- **Benefit**: User-granted, revocable permissions
- **Scope**: Only user-selected folders and files

## Results and Benefits

### User Experience Improvements
- **Complete Control**: Users define their own library locations
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple folders and individual files
- **Privacy**: No broad storage permissions required
- **Organization**: Hide unwanted books without deletion

### Technical Achievements
- **Modern Architecture**: SAF integration following Android best practices
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserved existing EPUB parsing functionality
- **Performance**: Efficient scanning with proper filtering
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code structure

### Security Enhancements
- **Scoped Access**: Only user-granted folder/file access
- **No Legacy Permissions**: Eliminated broad storage permissions
- **User Control**: Permissions managed through standard Android UI

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Cloud Storage**: Add support for cloud-based EPUB collections
- **Import/Export**: Library source configuration backup/restore
- **Advanced Filtering**: Genre, author, or metadata-based organization
- **Search**: Full-text search across library collection

### Technical Debt
- **UriFileResolver**: Consider migrating EPUB parser to work directly with URIs
- **Performance**: Implement background scanning for large libraries
- **Caching**: Add metadata caching to reduce repeated file access

## Conclusion

This project successfully modernized the EPUB library application while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality. The implementation provides users with complete control over their library sources using secure, modern Android practices. The modular architecture ensures maintainability and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

The key success factors were:
1. **User-Centric Design**: Prioritizing user control and flexibility
2. **Modern Security**: Implementing SAF for secure file access
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserving existing EPUB parsing functionality
4. **Clean Architecture**: Maintaining separation of concerns and modularity
